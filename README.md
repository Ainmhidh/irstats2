========

This is IRStats2 development repository. Note that the software is still at the beta stage, but it should be good enough for testing on your repository.

IRStats2 is a statistics reporting tool for EPrints. It can provide stats on any of the EPrints datasets (so not just downloads) in the form of reports. It is however possible to embed stats on any EPrints page. EPrints 3.3 administrators may install IRStats2 via the latest available epm package.
