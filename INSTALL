IRStats2 beta

Quick word
==========

Thanks for looking at the Beta version of IRStats2 - It's been tested already on a few live repositories and it is stable enough. It is very unlikely that installing IRStats2 on your 
repository will break it as it lives apart, in its own world...

If you do find bugs or if you have ideas for bringing this forward, please contact me directly or fill in a bug/comment on the project's Github page: https://github.com/eprints/irstats2 - also beware that there are many configuration options and it's possible to generate stats on pretty much anything. So don't feel restricted by what you see initially.

I hope you'll enjoy using it.

Quick Install Guide
===================

(*) EPrints 3.3+

If you're running 3.3 simply use the Bazaar package which is in the epm/ folder. Upload it via [Admin] > [System Tools] > [EPrints Bazaar] > [Available] and scroll down the bottom of the page.

I'll try to keep an up to date version of the epm/ (i.e. which reflects the files in Git).

You will be able to update the package following the same step, until the final release is there and ready.

Follow steps 6 to 9 in the instructions for EPrints 3.2 below to generate and view the stats. 


(*) EPrints 3.2

1- get the files from Git, though you've probably done that already since you're reading that file.

2- Copy the files to your local archive (it's likely I'll produce a Bazaar package when the release is ready):

cp bin/* /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/bin/
cp cfg/* /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/cfg/
cp cgi/* /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/cgi/

(create the bin and cgi directories if they don't exist).

3- Test everything is OK: /opt/eprints3/bin/epadmin test

4- Add in the <head> sections of your template files (usually located in /opt/eprints3/archives/<id>/cfg/lang/en/templates/) the following:

<!-- google charts -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.google.com/jsapi">// <!-- No script --></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
        google.load("visualization", "1", {packages:["corechart", "geochart"]});
</script>

5- Restart the web server

6- process the stats (note that this may take a loooong time (hours) to process the stats initially):

/opt/eprints3/archives/<id>/bin/stats/process_stats <id> --setup --verbose

7- Daily updates of the stats (e.g. via CRON) should be done without the "--setup" parameter (and probably without --verbose, but that's up to you)

8- Feel free to have a look at /opt/eprints3/archives/<id>/cfg/cfg.d/z_stats.pl and change some of the settings to reflect your repository's set-up.

9- Point your browser at http://your-repo-url/cgi/stats/report/ to view some figures!
